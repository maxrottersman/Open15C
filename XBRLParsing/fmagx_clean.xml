A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio turnover rate was 15% of the average value of its portfolio.</PortfolioTurnoverTextBlock>
  <StrategyHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000033738_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Investment Strategies &lt;/b&gt;</StrategyHeading>
  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000033738_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in master limited partnership (&amp;#8220;MLP&amp;#8221;) investments. Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a portfolio of MLPs investments, as defined below. This investment policy may be changed by the Fund upon 60 days&amp;#8217; prior written notice to shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MLPs typically are characterized as &amp;#8220;publicly traded partnerships&amp;#8221; that qualify to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are principally engaged in one or more aspects of the exploration, production, processing, transmission, marketing, storage or delivery of energy-related commodities, such as natural gas, natural gas liquids, coal, crude oil or refined petroleum products (collectively, the energy industry). The Fund&amp;#8217;s MLP investments include investments that offer economic exposure to public MLPs in the form of common or subordinated units issued by MLPs, securities of entities holding primarily general partner or managing member interests in MLPs, debt securities of MLPs, and securities that are derivatives of interests in MLPs, including I-Shares, warrants, and derivative instruments in which the Fund may invest that have economic characteristics of MLP securities. Certain of the benefits Fund shareholders are expected to derive from the Fund&amp;#8217;s MLP investments depend largely on the MLPs&amp;#8217; treatment as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See &amp;#8220;MLP Tax Risk&amp;#8221; below for additional details. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20% of the value of its total assets in a wide variety of securities and financial instruments, of all kinds and descriptions, that are not MLP investments, such as equity securities, equity-linked securities, fixed income securities (including &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;), and money market securities. The Fund may invest without limitation in exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;) and may invest up to 20% of the value of its total assets in ETFs that do not provide exposure to MLPs. The Fund may invest in securities of issuers of any market capitalization. The Fund may invest in securities of any credit quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers, which may include, without limitation, emerging market issuers. Such securities may be denominated in U.S. dollars, non-U.S. currencies or multinational currency units (such as the Euro). At times, the Fund intends to hedge currency exposure resulting from investments denominated in non U.S. currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derivatives, which are instruments that have a value based on another instrument, exchange rate or index, may be used as substitutes for securities in which the Fund can invest. The Fund may invest without limitation in warrants and may also use derivatives, primarily swaps (including equity, variance and volatility swaps), options and futures contracts on securities, interest rates, commodities and/or currencies, as substitutes for direct investments the Fund can make. The Fund may also use derivatives such as swaps, options (including options on futures), futures, and foreign currency transactions (e.g., foreign currency swaps, futures and forwards) to any extent deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund, and to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, to hedge various investments for risk management and speculative purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may borrow an amount up to 33 1/3% (or such other percentage permitted by law) of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less all liabilities other than borrowings. The Fund may borrow for investment purposes, to meet redemption requests and for temporary, extraordinary or emergency purposes. The use of borrowing for investment purposes (i.e., leverage) increases both investment opportunity and investment risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund&amp;#8217;s investment strategy utilizes the analytical models of the Adviser to evaluate potential investments. In selecting investments for the Fund, the Adviser typically focuses on MLP issuers that it believes: (i) have stable cash flows and pay regular distributions; (ii) have potential for long-term distribution growth; (iii) may be subject to a value catalyst, such as industry developments, regulatory changes, changes in management, acquisitions, sale or spin-off of a division; (iv) are well-managed;(v) will benefit from favorable demand and supply dynamics for its products and services; (vi) are best in class; and/or (vii) are underappreciated by market analysts. The Adviser will typically focus on companies that are exhibiting one or more of these indicators. Technical analysis may also be used to help in the decision making process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adviser may sell short securities of a company that it believes: (i) is overvalued relative to normalized business and industry fundamentals or to the expected growth that the Adviser believes the company will achieve; (ii) has a weak competitive position relative to peers; (iii) engages in questionable accounting practices; (iv) shows declining cash flow and/or liquidity; (v) has distribution estimates that the Adviser believes are too high; (vi) has weak competitive barriers to entry; (vii) suffers from deteriorating industry and/or business fundamentals; (viii) has a weak management team; (ix) will see multiple contraction; (x) is not adapting to changes in technological, regulatory or competitive environments; or (xi) provides a hedge against the Fund&amp;#8217;s long exposure, such as a broad based market ETF. Technical analysis may be used to help in the decision making process. The Fund may engage in short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box,&amp;#8221; which means that the Fund may sell short securities even when they are not actually owned or offset at all times during the period the short position is open. Short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box&amp;#8221; could result in unlimited loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adviser generates investment ideas from a variety of different sources. These include, but are not limited to, screening software that analyzes both fundamental and technical factors, industry contacts, consultants, company press releases, company conference calls, conversations with company management teams, buy-side contacts, sell-side contacts, brokers, third-party research, independent research of financial and corporate information, third-party research databases, and news services. The Adviser will make investment decisions based on its analysis of the security&amp;#8217;s value, and will also take into account its view of macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The Adviser will make investments without regard to a company&amp;#8217;s level of capitalization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investment objective of the Fund is not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval. The Fund is non-diversified as defined in the 1940 Act. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000033738_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks&lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000033738_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry Concentration Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Fund may be particularly susceptible to economic, political or regulatory events affecting those industries in which the Fund focuses its investments. Because the Fund normally invests at least 80% of the value of its assets in MLP investments, the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance largely depends on the overall condition of these industries and the Fund is susceptible to economic, political and regulatory risks or other occurrences associated with these industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;MLP Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in MLP units, which involves some risks that differ from an investment in the equity securities of a company. The Fund intends to invest substantially in MLP units. Holders of MLP units have limited control and voting rights on matters affecting the partnership. Holders of units issued by an MLP are exposed to a remote possibility of liability for all of the obligations of that MLP in the event that a court determines that the rights of the holders of MLP units to vote to remove or replace the general partner of that MLP, to approve amendments to that MLP&amp;#8217;s partnership agreement, or to take other action under the partnership agreement of that MLP would constitute &amp;#8220;control&amp;#8221; of the business of that MLP, or a court or governmental agency determines that the MLP is conducting business in a state without complying with the partnership statute of that state. Holders of MLP units are also exposed to the risk that they will be required to repay amounts to the MLP that are wrongfully distributed to them. Additionally: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; A sustained reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products could adversely affect MLP revenues and cash flows. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect the profitability of MLPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Investments in MLP units also present special tax risks. See &amp;#8220;MLP Tax Risk&amp;#8221; below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;MLP Tax Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the MLPs in which the Fund invests will fail to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to meet its investment objective will depend, in large measure, on the level of dividends, distributions or income it receives from the MLPs in which it invests and on the MLPs&amp;#8217; continued treatment as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an MLP does not meet current legal requirements to maintain its partnership status, or if it is unable to do so because of tax or other law changes, it would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that case, the MLP would be obligated to pay U.S. federal income tax (as well as state and local taxes) at the entity level on its taxable income and distributions received by the Fund would be taxable to the Fund as dividend income to the extent of the MLP&amp;#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal tax purposes. The classification of an MLP as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes could have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP and the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment in any such MLP. As a result, the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares and the cash available for distribution to Fund shareholders could be materially reduced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fund-Related Tax Risks&lt;/b&gt; are tax risks related to an investment in the Fund, including, but not limited to: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; C Corporation Structure Tax Risks. The Fund was formed in 2011 as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It adopted its current investing strategy during its taxable year that began in October 2012. Because the Fund invests and intends to invest primarily in MLPs, it no longer qualifies for treatment as a regulated investment company, and has not so qualified since 2012. Instead, the Fund is treated as a C corporation. Accordingly, unlike most mutual funds, the Fund is not entitled to pass-through tax treatment. Instead, the Fund generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment income and gains at the rates applicable to corporations as well as state and local taxes. Based on a review of the historic results of the types of MLPs in which the Fund invests, the Adviser currently expects that, from time to time, the cash distributions the Fund receives with respect to its investments in equity securities of MLPs will exceed the taxable income allocated to the Fund from such MLPs, due to a variety of factors, including significant non-cash deductions such as depreciation and depletion. Any such excess in a taxable year is not treated as income to the Fund, but rather as a tax-deferred return of capital to the Fund for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the extent of the Fund&amp;#8217;s basis in the MLP securities. Distributions the Fund receives from a MLP that exceed the Fund&amp;#8217;s basis in the securities of that MLP are treated as taxable income or gains in the Fund&amp;#8217;s hands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund&amp;#8217;s receipt of return-of-capital distributions from MLPs also causes the Fund&amp;#8217;s taxable income or gains to be higher, or losses to be lower, upon the ultimate sale of the MLP security by the Fund, and may cause taxable income or gains to be higher upon receipt of subsequent distributions from the MLP security by the Fund in later periods. The Fund&amp;#8217;s corporate income tax liability may be materially affected by, and may fluctuate materially from year to year depending on, a number of factors relating to the Fund and/or its MLP or other investments, including the extent to which the Fund disposes of MLP equity securities during a particular year, including, if necessary, to meet Fund shareholder redemption requests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund&amp;#8217;s tax liability each year will not be finally known until the Fund completes its annual tax return. The Fund&amp;#8217;s tax estimates could vary substantially from the actual liability and therefore the final determination of the Fund&amp;#8217;s actual tax liability may have a material impact on the Fund&amp;#8217;s net asset value. See &amp;#8220;Calculation of NAV Risk&amp;#8221; below. The payment of any corporate income taxes imposed on the Fund decreases the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares and the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the tax treatment of the Fund&amp;#8217;s allocations and distributions from MLPs, as described above, the Adviser currently expects that a significant portion of the Fund&amp;#8217;s distributions to shareholders will typically be treated as a return of capital in the hands of shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i.e., as distributions in excess of the Fund&amp;#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits) and thus will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of the shareholder&amp;#8217;s basis in its Fund shares. However, no assurance can be given in this regard and the extent to which the Fund is able to make return of capital distributions can vary materially from year to year. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Calculation of Net Asset Value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) Risk. In calculating the daily NAV, the Fund accounts for its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances. The Fund may accrue, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&amp;#8220;GAAP&amp;#8221;), a deferred income tax liability balance, at the currently effective statutory U.S. federal income tax rate plus an estimated state and local income tax rate, for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments, the distributions received by the Fund on equity securities of MLPs considered to be return of capital and any net operating income or realized gains. Any deferred tax liability balance reduces the Fund&amp;#8217;s NAV. Upon the Fund&amp;#8217;s sale of a portfolio security, the Fund may be liable for previously deferred taxes. If the Fund is required to sell portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, the Fund may recognize income and gains for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, which would result in corporate income taxes imposed on the Fund. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Fund may accrue, in accordance with GAAP, a deferred tax asset balance, at the currently effective statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, which reflects an estimate of the Fund&amp;#8217;s future tax benefit associated with net operating losses, capital loss carryforwards and unrealized losses. To the extent the Fund has a net deferred tax asset balance, the Fund may record a valuation allowance, which would offset the value of some or all of the Fund&amp;#8217;s deferred tax asset balance. The Fund assesses whether a valuation allowance is required, considering all available positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the Fund&amp;#8217;s deferred tax asset in connection with the calculation of the Fund&amp;#8217;s daily NAV. However, to the extent the final valuation allowance for a financial statement period differs from the estimates the Fund used in calculating the Fund&amp;#8217;s daily NAV, the application of such final valuation allowance could have a material impact on the Fund&amp;#8217;s NAV. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability (which are highly dependent on future cash distributions from the Fund&amp;#8217;s MLP holdings), the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the associated risk that operating and capital loss carryforwards may expire unused. From time to time, the Fund may modify its estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and the application of a valuation allowance with respect to a deferred tax asset as new information becomes available. Such modifications, changes in generally accepted accounting principles or related guidance or interpretations thereof, limitations imposed on net operating and capital losses (if any) and changes in applicable tax law, including changes in effective tax rates applicable to the Fund, such as the reduced corporate rate effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, could result in increases or decreases in the Fund&amp;#8217;s NAV per share, which could be material. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Tax Law Changes Risk. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations of those laws or regulations in the future could adversely affect the Fund or its MLPs or other investments, and could adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders. In some cases, such changes could have retroactive effect. For example, recently-adopted federal income tax reform legislation is expected to reduce the corporate tax rate payable by the Fund, which also reduces the value of any deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of the Fund. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the fact that the value of debt securities typically changes in response to various factors, including, by way of example, market-related factors (such as changes in interest rates or changes in the risk appetite of investors generally) and changes in the actual or perceived ability of the issuer (or of issuers generally) to meet its (or their) obligations. During periods of rising interest rates, debt securities generally decline in value. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, debt securities generally rise in value. This kind of market risk is generally greater for funds investing in debt securities with longer maturities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, warrants, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in securities of issuers tied economically to emerging markets, which entails all of the risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers detailed below under &amp;#8220;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&amp;#8221; to a heightened degree. These heightened risks include: (i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization, and less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the smaller size of the markets for such securities and a lower volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility; (iii) greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and (iv) certain national policies that may restrict the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment opportunities, including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hedging Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that, although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry Specific Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the MLPs in which the Fund invests will be impacted by risks specific to the industry MLPs serve, including the following: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Fluctuations in commodity prices may impact the volume of commodities transported, processed, stored or distributed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities available for transporting, processing, storing or distributing may affect the profitability of an MLP. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions can limit growth potential. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; A sustained reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products could adversely affect MLP revenues and cash flows. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities if not replaced, could impact an MLP&amp;#8217;s ability to make distributions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect the profitability of MLPs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Extreme weather and environmental hazards could impact the value of MLP securities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rising interest rates could result in a higher cost of capital and drive investors into other investment opportunities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets could impact the market for MLPs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Large Shareholder Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a significant percentage of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares may be owned or controlled by a large shareholder, such as other funds or accounts, including those of which the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser may have investment discretion. Accordingly, the Fund can be subject to the potential for large scale inflows and outflows as a result of purchases and redemptions made by significant shareholders. These inflows and outflows could be significant and, if frequently occurring, could negatively affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s net asset value and performance and could cause the Fund to sell securities at inopportune times in order to meet redemption requests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legislation Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that to the extent that state, federal or international regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions with respect to MLPs, the availability of MLP investments may be adversely affected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the use of leverage for investment purposes to create opportunities for greater total returns. Any investment income or gains earned with respect to the amounts borrowed that are in excess of the interest that is due on the borrowing will augment the Fund&amp;#8217;s income. Conversely, if the investment performance with respect to the amounts borrowed fails to cover the interest on such borrowings, the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares may decrease more quickly than would otherwise be the case. Interest payments and fees incurred in connection with such borrowings will reduce the amount of net income available for payment to Fund shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in securities of mid-cap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline significantly as market conditions change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that an investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund. As a non-diversified fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of fewer issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund&amp;#8217;s investment in fewer issuers may result in the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Payment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal with respect to debt instruments. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepayment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates. This may cause the Fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates. This may adversely affect the NAV of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restricted Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Adviser may not be able to sell restricted securities, such as securities issued pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies either directly or indirectly through investments in ETFs, closed-end funds or mutual funds (&amp;#8220;Underlying Funds&amp;#8221;) may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swaps Risk&lt;/b&gt; involves both the risks associated with an investment in the underlying investments or instruments (including equity investments) and counterparty risk. In a standard over-the-counter (&amp;#8220;OTC&amp;#8221;) swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns, differentials in rates of return or some other amount calculated based on the &amp;#8220;notional amount&amp;#8221; of predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for an interest factor. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investments in securities, because swaps may be leveraged and OTC swaps are subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty&amp;#8217;s defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. Certain swap transactions, including interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps, may be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading, although the swaps in which the Fund will invest are not currently subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques, risk analyses and tax planning different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The value of swaps, like many other derivatives, may move in unexpected ways and may result in losses for the Fund.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000033738_Member">The bar chart and the Average Annual Total Returns table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the performance of the Fund&amp;#8217;s Class A Shares for each full calendar year and by showing how the Fund&amp;#8217;s average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index or indices. As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower. Both the chart and the table assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. The bar chart does not reflect the deduction of applicable sales charges for Class A Shares. If sales charges had been reflected, the returns for Class A Shares would be less than those shown below. The returns of Class C and Class Y Shares would have substantially similar returns as Class A because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the classes have different expenses (including sales charges). Updated information on the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance can be obtained by visiting http://highlandfunds.com/highland-funds-2/ or by calling 1-877-665-1287. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective February 1, 2013, the Fund revised its investment strategy to focus on MLP investments. Returns through September 30, 2012 reflect the Fund&amp;#8217;s treatment as a regulated investment company under the Code. Returns after September 30, 2012 reflect the Fund&amp;#8217;s treatment as a regular corporation, or &amp;#8220;C&amp;#8221; corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, returns after September 30, 2012 generally will be reduced by the amount of entity-level income taxes paid by the Fund as a regular corporation and thus will not necessarily be comparable to returns reported while the Fund still qualified as a regulated investment company.</PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock>

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor&amp;#8217;s tax situation and may differ from those shown. For example, after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, average annual return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares is higher than the return before taxes and the average annual return after taxes on distributions because of realized losses that would have been sustained upon the sale of fund shares immediately after the relevant periods. The calculations assume that an investor holds the shares in a taxable account, is in the actual historical highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket for each year and would have been able to immediately utilize the full realized loss to reduce his or her federal tax liability. However, actual individual tax results may vary and investors should consult their tax advisers regarding their personal tax situations.</PerformanceTableNarrativeTextBlock>

These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

  <StrategyHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001621_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Investment Strategies &lt;/b&gt;</StrategyHeading>
  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001621_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing at least 80% of its net assets under normal circumstances in equity securities, such as common and preferred stocks. This investment policy may be changed by the Fund upon 60 days&amp;#8217; prior written notice to shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund invests primarily in a limited number of large- and medium-sized companies (meaning companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion or more) that the portfolio managers believe have above-average growth histories and/or growth potential. The portfolio managers select equity securities from a number of industries based on the merits of individual companies. At times, the portfolio managers may focus investments in a particular sector or sectors of the economy. In seeking to satisfy the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective with respect to future income, the portfolio managers will also consider companies that have the potential to pay dividends in the future. Stock selection is key to the performance of the Fund. The Fund may also sell securities short. Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. (&amp;#8220;HCMFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Adviser&amp;#8221;) will vary the Fund&amp;#8217;s long and short exposures over time based on its assessment of market conditions and other factors. The Adviser may also utilize event-driven strategies that are based on investment opportunities created by significant transactional events, such as spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions, industry consolidations, liquidations, reorganizations, bankruptcies, recapitalizations, share buybacks and other extraordinary corporate transactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio managers seek to identify securities of companies with characteristics such as:&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; above-average annual growth rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; financial strength (favorable debt ratios and other financial characteristics)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; leadership in their respective industries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; high quality management focused on generating shareholder value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The portfolio managers may consider selling a security when one of these characteristics no longer applies, or when valuation becomes excessive and more attractive alternatives are identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund also may invest to a lesser extent in securities of foreign (non-U.S.) issuers and debt securities. The portfolio managers may also invest in exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;). The Fund may invest without limitation in warrants and may also use derivatives, primarily swaps (including equity, variance and volatility swaps), options and futures contracts on securities, interest rates, commodities and/or currencies, as substitutes for direct investments the Fund can make. The Fund may also use derivatives such as swaps, options (including options on futures), futures, and foreign currency transactions (e.g., foreign currency swaps, futures and forwards) to any extent deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund, and to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &amp;#8220;1940 Act&amp;#8221;), to hedge various investments for risk management and speculative purposes.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001621_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks &lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001621_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event-Driven Investing Risk.&lt;/b&gt; Event-driven strategies analyze various transactions in order to predict a likely outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome. Event-driven strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse set of securities, including common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stubs and derivatives. Appreciation in the value of such securities may be contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a successful reorganization or merger. If the expected event does not occur, the Fund may incur a loss on the investments. There can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place. Certain transactions are dependent on one or more factors to become effective, such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile, shareholder approval, regulatory and various other third party constraints, changes in earnings or business lines or shareholder activism as well as many other factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focused Investment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that although the Fund is a diversified fund, it may invest in securities of a limited number of issuers in an effort to achieve a potentially greater investment return than a fund that invests in a larger number of issuers. As a result, price movements of a single issuer&amp;#8217;s securities will have a greater impact on the Fund&amp;#8217;s net asset value, causing it to fluctuate more than that of a more widely diversified fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growth Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in growth stocks that may be more volatile than other stocks because they are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company&amp;#8217;s growth potential. Growth-oriented funds will typically underperform when value investing is in favor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hedging Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that, although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in securities of mid-cap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline significantly as market conditions change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sector Risk &lt;/b&gt;is the risk that a Fund focuses its investments in issuers of one or a few specific economic sectors, the Fund may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified across the economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short Sales Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of loss associated with any appreciation on the price of a security borrowed in connection with a short sale. The Fund may engage in short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box,&amp;#8221; which means that the Fund may sell short securities even when they are not actually owned or otherwise covered at all times during the period the short position is open. Short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box&amp;#8221; involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swaps Risk&lt;/b&gt; involves both the risks associated with an investment in the underlying investments or instruments (including equity investments) and counterparty risk. In a standard over-the-counter (&amp;#8220;OTC&amp;#8221;) swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns, differentials in rates of return or some other amount calculated based on the &amp;#8220;notional amount&amp;#8221; of predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for an interest factor. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investments in securities, because swaps may be leveraged and OTC swaps are subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty&amp;#8217;s defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. Certain swap transactions, including interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps, may be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading, although the swaps in which the Fund will invest are not currently subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques, risk analyses and tax planning different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The value of swaps, like many other derivatives, may move in unexpected ways and may result in losses for the Fund.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001621_Member">The bar chart and the Average Annual Total Returns table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the performance of the Fund&amp;#8217;s Class A Shares for each full calendar year and by showing how the Fund&amp;#8217;s average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index or indices. As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future.

If the Fund&amp;#8217;s current management had been in place for the prior periods, the performance information shown would have been different. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower. Both the chart and the table assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. The bar chart does not reflect the deduction of applicable sales charges for Class A Shares. If sales charges had been reflected, the returns for Class A Shares would be less than those shown below. The returns of Class C and Class Y Shares would have substantially similar returns as Class A because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the classes have different expenses (including sales charges).

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor&amp;#8217;s tax situation and may differ from those shown. For example, after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, average annual return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares is higher than the return before taxes and the average annual return after taxes on distributions because of realized losses that would have been sustained upon the sale of fund shares immediately after the relevant periods. The calculations assume that an investor holds the shares in a taxable account, is in the actual historical highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket for each year and would have been able to immediately utilize the full realized loss to reduce his or her federal tax liability. However, actual individual tax results may vary and investors should consult their tax advisers regarding their personal tax situations.</PerformanceTableNarrativeTextBlock>

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

  <StrategyHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001623_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Investment Strategies &lt;/b&gt;</StrategyHeading>
  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001623_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets under normal circumstances in equity securities, such as common and preferred stocks, of small-cap companies, plus borrowing for investment purposes. This investment policy may be changed by the Fund upon 60 days&amp;#8217; prior written notice to shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund uses an investment strategy that combines growth, value and core investment management styles. The Fund defines a small-cap company as one with a market capitalization that falls between (a) the bottom range of the S&amp;amp;P Small-Cap 600 Index (&amp;#8220;Small-Cap 600 Index&amp;#8221;) and (b) the greater of either the top range of the Small-Cap 600 Index or $4.4 billion. As of November 30, 2018, the market capitalization of companies in the Small-Cap 600 Index ranged from $63.5 million to $4.4 billion.1 The portfolio manager will not sell a stock merely because the market capitalization of a company in the portfolio moves outside its capitalization range or because the index capitalization range changes. Stock selection is key to the performance of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The Small-Cap 600 Index measures the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. The Index is designed to track companies that meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure that they are liquid and financially viable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager seeks to identify securities of companies with characteristics such as:&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; high quality management focused on generating shareholder value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; attractive products or services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; appropriate capital structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; strong competitive positions in their industries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;At times, the portfolio manager may focus investments in a particular sector or sectors of the economy. The portfolio manager may consider selling a security when one of these characteristics no longer applies, or when valuation becomes excessive and more attractive alternatives are identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may borrow for investment purposes. To the extent the Fund borrows and invests the proceeds, the Fund will create financial leverage. The use of borrowing for investment purposes increases both investment opportunity and investment risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may invest in securities issued by real estate investment trusts (&amp;#8220;REITs&amp;#8221;). REITs are publicly traded corporations or trusts that specialize in acquiring, holding and managing residential, commercial or industrial real estate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may also sell securities short and use futures and options to gain short exposure. The Adviser will vary the Fund&amp;#8217;s long and short exposures over time based on its assessment of market conditions and other factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund also may invest to a lesser extent in securities with capitalizations outside the Fund&amp;#8217;s small-cap range, debt securities and foreign (non-U.S.) securities. The Fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;). The Fund may invest without limitation in warrants and may also use derivatives, primarily swaps (including equity, variance and volatility swaps), options and futures contracts on securities, interest rates, commodities and/or currencies, as substitutes for direct investments the Fund can make. The Fund may also use derivatives such as swaps, options (including options on futures), futures, and foreign currency transactions (e.g., foreign currency swaps, futures and forwards) to any extent deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund, and to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, to hedge various investments for risk management and speculative purposes. The Fund may also invest in master limited partnerships (&amp;#8220;MLPs&amp;#8221;), which are typically characterized as &amp;#8220;publicly traded partnerships&amp;#8221; that qualify to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are principally engaged in one or more aspects of the exploration, production, processing, transmission, marketing, storage or delivery of energy-related commodities, such as natural gas, natural gas liquids, coal, crude oil or refined petroleum products (collectively, the energy industry).</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001623_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks &lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001623_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focused Investment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that although the Fund is a diversified fund, it may invest in securities of a limited number of issuers in an effort to achieve a potentially greater investment return than a fund that invests in a larger number of issuers. As a result, price movements of a single issuer&amp;#8217;s securities will have a greater impact on the Fund&amp;#8217;s net asset value, causing it to fluctuate more than that of a more widely diversified fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growth Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in growth stocks that may be more volatile than other stocks because they are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company&amp;#8217;s growth potential. Growth-oriented funds will typically underperform when value investing is in favor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hedging Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that, although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the use of leverage for investment purposes to create opportunities for greater total returns. Any investment income or gains earned with respect to the amounts borrowed that are in excess of the interest that is due on the borrowing will augment the Fund&amp;#8217;s income. Conversely, if the investment performance with respect to the amounts borrowed fails to cover the interest on such borrowings, the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares may decrease more quickly than would otherwise be the case. Interest payments and fees incurred in connection with such borrowings will reduce the amount of net income available for payment to Fund shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;MLP Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in MLP units, which involves some risks that differ from an investment in the equity securities of a company. The Fund may invest in MLP units. Holders of MLP units have limited control and voting rights on matters affecting the partnership. Holders of units issued by an MLP are exposed to a remote possibility of liability for all of the obligations of that MLP in certain instances. Holders of MLP units are also exposed to the risk that they will be required to repay amounts to the MLP that are wrongfully distributed to them. Additionally, a sustained reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products could adversely affect MLP revenues and cash flows and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect the profitability of MLPs. Investments in MLP units also present special tax risks. See &amp;#8220;MLP Tax Risk&amp;#8221; below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;MLP Tax Risk &lt;/b&gt;is the risk that the MLPs in which the Fund invests will fail to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an MLP does not meet current legal requirements to maintain its partnership status, or if it is unable to do so because of tax or other law changes, it would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that case, the MLP would be obligated to pay U.S. federal income tax (as well as state and local taxes) at the entity level on its taxable income and distributions received by the Fund would be characterized as dividend income to the extent of the MLP&amp;#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal tax purposes. The classification of an MLP as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes could have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP and the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment in any such MLP. As a result, the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares and the cash available for distribution to Fund shareholders could be reduced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Estate Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that an investment in real estate securities will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. Property values or income may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, cultural or technological developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REIT-Specific Risk&lt;/b&gt; includes the risk that an investment in the stocks of real estate investment trusts (&amp;#8220;REITs&amp;#8221;) will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. An investment in a REIT also may be adversely affected or lost if the REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sector Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that if the Fund focuses its investments in issuers of one or a few specific economic sectors, the Fund may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified across the economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short Sales Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of loss associated with any appreciation on the price of a security borrowed in connection with a short sale. The Fund may engage in short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box,&amp;#8221; which means that the Fund may sell short securities even when they are not actually owned or otherwise covered at all times during the period the short position is open. Short sales that are not made &amp;#8220;against-the-box&amp;#8221; involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies either directly or indirectly through investments in ETFs, closed-end funds or mutual funds (&amp;#8220;Underlying Funds&amp;#8221;) may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swaps Risk&lt;/b&gt; involves both the risks associated with an investment in the underlying investments or instruments (including equity investments) and counterparty risk. In a standard over-the-counter (&amp;#8220;OTC&amp;#8221;) swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns, differentials in rates of return or some other amount calculated based on the &amp;#8220;notional amount&amp;#8221; of predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for an interest factor. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investments in securities, because swaps may be leveraged and OTC swaps are subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty&amp;#8217;s defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. Certain swap transactions, including interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps, may be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading, although the swaps in which the Fund will invest are not currently subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques, risk analyses and tax planning different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The value of swaps, like many other derivatives, may move in unexpected ways and may result in losses for the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value. Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks. Value-oriented funds will typically underperform when growth investing is in favor.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001623_Member">The bar chart and the Average Annual Total Returns table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the performance of the Fund&amp;#8217;s Class A Shares for each full calendar year and by showing how the Fund&amp;#8217;s average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index or indices. As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance prior to February 18, 2011 reflects returns achieved when the Fund was managed by a different investment adviser. If the Fund&amp;#8217;s current management had been in place for the prior periods, the performance information shown would have been different. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower. Both the chart and the table assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. The bar chart does not reflect the deduction of applicable sales charges for Class A Shares. If sales charges had been reflected, the returns for Class A Shares would be less than those shown below. The returns of Class C and Class Y Shares would have substantially similar returns as Class A because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the classes have different expenses (including sales charges).

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor&amp;#8217;s tax situation and may differ from those shown. For example, after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, average annual return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares is higher than the return before taxes and the average annual return after taxes on distributions because of realized losses that would have been sustained upon the sale of fund shares immediately after the relevant periods. The calculations assume that an investor holds the shares in a taxable account, is in the actual historical highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket for each year and would have been able to immediately utilize the full realized loss to reduce his or her federal tax liability. However, actual individual tax results may vary and investors should consult their tax advisers regarding their personal tax situations.</PerformanceTableNarrativeTextBlock>

These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001613_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets under normal circumstances in debt securities. This investment policy may be changed by the Fund upon 60 days&amp;#8217; prior written notice to shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. (&amp;#8220;HCMFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment adviser, has allocated all the assets of the Fund to be managed/advised by First Foundation Advisors (&amp;#8220;FFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Sub-Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s sub-adviser. The Fund invests primarily in a variety of investment-grade debt securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, U.S. Government securities, investment-grade municipal obligations and money market instruments. The Fund normally has a weighted average maturity of approximately five to ten years, but is subject to no limitation with respect to the maturities of the instruments in which it may invest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Government securities are securities that are issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some U.S. Government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, such as U.S. Treasury bills and notes and obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Other U.S. Government securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, including those issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been operating under a conservatorship since 2008, with the Federal Housing Finance Authority acting as their conservator, and receive certain financing support from and have access to certain borrowing arrangements with the U.S. Treasury. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager seeks to identify debt securities with characteristics such as:&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; attractive yields and prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; the potential for capital appreciation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; reasonable credit quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The portfolio manager may consider selling a security when one of these characteristics no longer applies, or when valuation becomes excessive and more attractive alternatives are identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund also may invest to a lesser extent in non-mortgage asset-backed securities, high yield securities (also known as &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;), foreign (non-U.S.) and emerging market debt securities and equity securities, such as exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager may also use various types of derivatives (such as options, futures and options on futures) to manage interest rate risk (also known as duration) and to manage exposure to credit quality. The reference in the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective to capital preservation does not indicate that the Fund may not lose money. The investment adviser seeks to employ strategies that are consistent with capital preservation, but there can be no assurance that the investment adviser will be successful in doing so.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001613_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks &lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001613_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asset-Backed Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in asset-backed securities, and includes interest rate risk, prepayment risk and the risk that the Fund could lose money if there are defaults on the loans underlying these securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the fact that the value of debt securities typically changes in response to various factors, including, by way of example, market-related factors (such as changes in interest rates or changes in the risk appetite of investors generally) and changes in the actual or perceived ability of the issuer (or of issuers generally) to meet its (or their) obligations. During periods of rising interest rates, debt securities generally decline in value. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, debt securities generally rise in value. This kind of market risk is generally greater for funds investing in debt securities with longer maturities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in securities of issuers tied economically to emerging markets, which entails all of the risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers detailed below under &amp;#8220;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&amp;#8221; to a heightened degree. These heightened risks include: (i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization, and less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the smaller size of the markets for such securities and a lower volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility; (iii) greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and (iv) certain national policies that may restrict the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment opportunities, including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;High Yield Debt Securities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that below investment grade securities or unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as &amp;#8220;high yield securities&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;) are more likely to default than higher rated securities. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. The market value of these securities is generally more sensitive to corporate developments and economic conditions and can be volatile. Market conditions can diminish liquidity and make accurate valuations difficult to obtain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in mortgage-backed securities, and includes interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, which may be heightened in connection with investments in loans to &amp;#8220;subprime&amp;#8221; borrowers. Certain mortgage-backed securities are also subject to prepayment risk. Mortgage-backed securities, because they are backed by mortgage loans, are also subject to risks related to real estate, and securities backed by private-issued mortgages may experience higher rates of default on the underlying mortgages than securities backed by government-issued mortgages. The Fund could lose money if there are defaults on the mortgage loans underlying these securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Municipal Obligations Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in municipal securities, and includes interest rate risk and the credit risk of the issuers of municipal securities. The municipal securities market is volatile and may be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes. To the extent that the Fund remains relatively small, it may have fewer favorable investment opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepayment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates. This may cause the Fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates. This may adversely affect the NAV of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restricted Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Sub-Adviser may not be able to sell restricted securities, such as securities issued pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

  <PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001613_Member">The bar chart and the Average Annual Total Returns table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the performance of the Fund&amp;#8217;s Class A Shares for each full calendar year and by showing how the Fund&amp;#8217;s average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index or indices. As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance prior to August 1, 2014 reflects returns achieved when the Fund was sub-advised by a different sub-adviser. If the Fund&amp;#8217;s current management had been in place for the prior periods, the performance information shown would have been different. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower. Both the chart and the table assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. The bar chart does not reflect the deduction of applicable sales charges for Class A Shares. If sales charges had been reflected, the returns for Class A Shares would be less than those shown below. The returns of Class C and Class Y Shares would have substantially similar returns as Class A because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the classes have different expenses (including sales charges).

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor&amp;#8217;s tax situation and may differ from those shown. For example, after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, average annual return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares is higher than the return before taxes and the average annual return after taxes on distributions because of realized losses that would have been sustained upon the sale of fund shares immediately after the relevant periods. The calculations assume that an investor holds the shares in a taxable account, is in the actual historical highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket for each year and would have been able to immediately utilize the full realized loss to reduce his or her federal tax liability. However, actual individual tax results may vary and investors should consult their tax advisers regarding their personal tax situations.</PerformanceTableNarrativeTextBlock>

  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000056699_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing under normal market conditions primarily in income-producing securities (such as debt securities, preferred stocks, high dividend-bearing common stock, and common and preferred stock of closed-end investment companies (&amp;#8220;closed-end funds&amp;#8221;) that have the potential to offer long-term growth of income and capital appreciation. The Fund invests primarily in companies with large market capitalizations that fall within the range of those companies included in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Value Index and that typically exhibit &amp;#8220;value&amp;#8221; characteristics. The Fund will seek to identify those companies that appear to be undervalued by various measures and may be temporarily out of favor but have good prospects for capital appreciation and dividend growth. The Fund may write (sell) covered call options on securities the Fund holds in its portfolio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. (&amp;#8220;HCMFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment adviser, has allocated all the assets of the Fund to be managed/advised by First Foundation Advisors (&amp;#8220;FFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Sub-Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s sub-adviser. The Sub-Adviser utilizes a dynamic approach that seeks to maximize income, within the context of the level of risk taken. The Sub-Adviser&amp;#8217;s asset allocation strategy involves making adjustments to the Fund&amp;#8217;s portfolio, utilizing among other things the Sub-Adviser&amp;#8217;s research on various risk and income considerations, in an effort to optimize yields relative to risks as market and economic conditions change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may invest in securities issued by real estate investment trusts (&amp;#8220;REITs&amp;#8221;). REITs are publicly traded corporations or trusts that specialize in acquiring, holding and managing residential, commercial or industrial real estate. The Fund may borrow for investment purposes, to meet redemption requests and for temporary, extraordinary or emergency purposes. The use of borrowing for investment purposes (i.e., leverage) increases both investment opportunity and investment risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may invest in debt obligations of any kind, of any quality, and of any maturity, including in securities that at the time of investment are rated below investment grade. A security will be considered to be below investment grade if it is rated as such by one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (&amp;#8220;NRSRO&amp;#8221;) (for example, Ba1 or below by Moody&amp;#8217;s or BB+ or below by S&amp;amp;P or Fitch), or, if unrated is judged to be below investment grade by the Sub-Adviser. Such securities are commonly known as &amp;#8220;high-yield&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;junk&amp;#8221; securities. The Fund may invest without limitation in below investment grade or unrated securities, including insolvent borrowers or borrowers in default. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In selecting closed-end funds for the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will invest in closed-end funds which, in choosing corporate debt securities in which they invest, adhere to ratings criteria no less strict than those followed by the Fund in selecting its direct investments that incorporate debt securities at the time of purchase. Such closed-end funds may invest in debt securities of United States or foreign issuers. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds subject to the limits set forth in the 1940 Act that apply to those types of investments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may invest up to 25% of the value of its total assets in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers. Such securities may be denominated in U.S. dollars, non-U.S. currencies or multinational currency units. The Fund may engage in foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and other similar strategic transactions in connection with its investments in securities of non-U.S. companies. The Fund&amp;#8217;s primary use of foreign currency transactions will be to seek to reduce the foreign currency risk inherent in the Fund&amp;#8217;s investments, although it will not be required to do so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reference in the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objectives to capital preservation does not indicate that the Fund may not lose money. The Sub-Adviser seeks to employ strategies that are consistent with capital preservation, but there can be no assurance that the Sub-Adviser will be successful in doing so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the Fund may invest in any stock or other equity security that the Sub-Adviser believes may assist the Fund in pursuing its investment objectives, including income producing common and preferred stocks issued by domestic and foreign companies of any size (including smaller companies with market capitalizations of less than $500 million, and companies in developing countries), publicly traded REITs and publicly traded partnerships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investment objective of the Fund is not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval. The Fund is non-diversified as defined in the 1940 Act. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000056699_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks &lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000056699_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the fact that the value of debt securities typically changes in response to various factors, including, by way of example, market-related factors (such as changes in interest rates or changes in the risk appetite of investors generally) and changes in the actual or perceived ability of the issuer (or of issuers generally) to meet its (or their) obligations. During periods of rising interest rates, debt securities generally decline in value. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, debt securities generally rise in value. This kind of market risk is generally greater for funds investing in debt securities with longer maturities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distressed and Defaulted Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Fund may invest in the securities of financially distressed and bankrupt issuers, including debt obligations that are in covenant or payment default. Such investments generally trade significantly below par and are considered speculative. The repayment of defaulted obligations is subject to significant uncertainties. Defaulted obligations might be repaid only after lengthy workout or bankruptcy proceedings, during which the issuer might not make any interest or other payments. Typically such workout or bankruptcy proceedings result in only partial recovery of cash payments or an exchange of the defaulted obligation for other debt or equity securities of the issuer or its affiliates, which may in turn be illiquid or speculative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in securities of issuers tied economically to emerging markets, which entails all of the risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers detailed below under &amp;#8220;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&amp;#8221; to a heightened degree. These heightened risks include: (i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization, and less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the smaller size of the markets for such securities and a lower volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility; (iii) greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and (iv) certain national policies that may restrict the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment opportunities, including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hedging Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that, although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;High Yield Debt Securities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that below investment grade securities or unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as &amp;#8220;high yield securities&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;) are more likely to default than higher rated securities. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. The market value of these securities is generally more sensitive to corporate developments and economic conditions and can be volatile. Market conditions can diminish liquidity and make accurate valuations difficult to obtain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Illiquid and Restricted Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Sub-Adviser may not be able to sell illiquid or restricted securities, such as securities issued pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss. Securities of non-U.S. issuers, and emerging or developing markets securities in particular, are subject to greater liquidity risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the use of leverage for investment purposes to create opportunities for greater total returns. Any investment income or gains earned with respect to the amounts borrowed that are in excess of the interest that is due on the borrowing will augment the Fund&amp;#8217;s income. Conversely, if the investment performance with respect to the amounts borrowed fails to cover the interest on such borrowings, the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares may decrease more quickly than would otherwise be the case. Interest payments and fees incurred in connection with such borrowings will reduce the amount of net income available for payment to Fund shareholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in securities of mid-cap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline significantly as market conditions change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Diversification Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that an investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund. As a non-diversified fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of fewer issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund&amp;#8217;s investment in fewer issuers may result in the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Options Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investments in options. Options, such as covered calls and covered puts, are subject to the risk that significant differences between the securities and options markets could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Investment Companies Risk &lt;/b&gt;is the risk that to the extent the Fund invests a portion of its assets in investment companies, including open-end funds, closed-end funds, ETFs and other types of investment companies, those assets will be subject to the risks of the purchased investment companies&amp;#8217; portfolio securities, and a shareholder in the Fund will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses, but also indirectly the expenses of the purchased investment companies. Risks associated with investments in closed-end funds also generally include market risk, leverage risk, risk of market price discount from NAV, risk of anti-takeover provisions and non-diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publicly Traded Partnership Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in publicly traded partnerships (including master limited partnerships) which involves special risks in addition to those typically associated with publicly traded companies. Publicly traded partnerships are exposed to the risks of their underlying assets, which in many cases includes the same types of risks as energy and natural resources companies, such as commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk and depletion and exploration risk. Publicly traded partnerships are also subject to capital markets risk, which is the risk that they may be unable to raise capital to execute their growth strategies. Publicly traded partnerships are also subject to tax risk, which is the risk that publicly traded partnerships may lose their partnership status for tax purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Estate Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that an investment in real estate securities will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. Property values or income may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, cultural or technological developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REIT-Specific Risk&lt;/b&gt; includes the risk that an investment in the stocks of real estate investment trusts (&amp;#8220;REITs&amp;#8221;) will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. An investment in a REIT also may be adversely affected or lost if the REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies either directly or indirectly through investments in ETFs, closed-end funds or mutual funds (&amp;#8220;Underlying Funds&amp;#8221;) may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value. Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks. Value-oriented funds will typically underperform when growth investing is in favor.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s performance.

  <StrategyNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001614_Member">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in investment-grade municipal obligations. Under normal circumstances, the portfolio manager manages the Fund so that at least 80% of the Fund&amp;#8217;s income is exempt from both regular federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. (&amp;#8220;HCMFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment adviser, has allocated all the assets of the Fund to be managed/advised by First Foundation Advisors (&amp;#8220;FFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Sub-Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s sub-adviser. The Fund generally will have an effective duration of 75% to 125% of the duration of the Bloomberg Barclays 10-Year Municipal Bond Index. As of December 31, 2018, the effective duration of the Bloomberg Barclays 10-Year Municipal Bond Index was 5.81 years. Portfolio duration is one measure of risk, as noted under &amp;#8220;Interest Rate Risk&amp;#8221; below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio manager seeks to identify municipal obligations with characteristics such as: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; attractive yields and prices &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; the potential for income generation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; the potential for capital appreciation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; reasonable credit quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The portfolio manager may consider selling a security when one of these characteristics no longer applies, or when valuation becomes excessive and more attractive alternatives are identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund also may invest to a lesser extent in tax-free or taxable money market instruments and may hold cash. The portfolio manager may also use various types of derivatives (such as options, futures and options on futures) to manage interest rate exposure (also known as duration) and to manage exposure to credit quality. The Fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund&amp;#8217;s policy that at least 80% of its income be exempt from both regular federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax may only be changed with shareholder approval. The reference in the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment objective to capital preservation does not indicate that the Fund may not lose money. The investment adviser seeks to employ strategies that are consistent with capital preservation, but there can be no assurance that the investment adviser will be successful in doing so.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001614_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks&lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001614_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the fact that the value of debt securities typically changes in response to various factors, including, by way of example, market-related factors (such as changes in interest rates or changes in the risk appetite of investors generally) and changes in the actual or perceived ability of the issuer (or of issuers generally) to meet its (or their) obligations. During periods of rising interest rates, debt securities generally decline in value. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, debt securities generally rise in value. This kind of market risk is generally greater for funds investing in debt securities with longer maturities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Municipal Obligations Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in municipal securities, and includes interest rate risk and the credit risk of the issuers of municipal securities. The municipal securities market is volatile and may be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes. To the extent that the Fund remains relatively small, it may have fewer favorable investment opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepayment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates. This may cause the Fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates. This may adversely affect the NAV of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance prior to August 1, 2014 reflects returns achieved when the Fund was sub-advised by a different sub-adviser. If the Fund&amp;#8217;s current management had been in place for the prior periods, the performance information shown would have been different. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower. Both the chart and the table assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. The bar chart does not reflect the deduction of applicable sales charges for Class A Shares. If sales charges had been reflected, the returns for Class A Shares would be less than those shown below. The returns of Class C and Class Y Shares would have substantially similar returns as Class A because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the classes have different expenses (including sales charges).

The calculations assume that an investor holds the shares in a taxable account, is in the actual historical highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket for each year and would have been able to immediately utilize the full realized loss to reduce his or her federal tax liability.

The Fund may also use various types of derivatives (such as options, futures and options on futures) to gain exposure to certain types of securities as an alternative to investing directly in such securities, to manage currency exposure and interest rate exposure (also known as duration), and to manage exposure to credit quality. The Fund may hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk but is not required to do so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. (&amp;#8220;HCMFA&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Adviser&amp;#8221;), the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment adviser, has allocated all the assets of the Fund to be managed/advised by FFA. The Fund invests in equity securities, such as common and preferred stocks, principally for their capital appreciation potential and investment-grade debt securities principally for their income potential. The Fund invests in cash principally for the preservation of capital, income potential or maintenance of liquidity. Within each asset class, the portfolio managers primarily use active security selection to choose securities based on the perceived merits of individual issuers, although portfolio managers of different asset classes or strategies may place different emphasis on the various characteristics of a company (as identified below) during the selection process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portfolio managers seek to identify equity securities of companies with characteristics such as: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; strong earnings growth &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; favorable valuation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; a presence in successful industries &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; high quality management focused on generating shareholder value &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; large or medium capitalization (meaning a market capitalization of $2 billion or more) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The portfolio managers seek to identify debt securities with characteristics such as: &lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; attractive yields and prices &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; the potential for capital appreciation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt; reasonable credit quality (typically investment grade debt securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, U.S. Government securities and money market instruments) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The portfolio managers may consider selling a security when one of these characteristics no longer applies, or when valuation becomes excessive and more attractive alternatives are identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portion of the Fund invested in debt securities normally has a weighted average maturity of approximately five to ten years, but is subject to no limitation with respect to the maturities of the instruments in which it may invest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fund may also invest to a lesser extent in high yield securities (also known as &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;), equity and debt securities of companies that are located in emerging market countries, and exchange-traded funds (&amp;#8220;ETFs&amp;#8221;) to gain exposure to securities including those of U.S. issuers that are principally engaged in or related to the real estate industry and to securities in emerging markets.</StrategyNarrativeTextBlock>
  <RiskHeading contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001624_Member">&lt;b&gt;Principal Risks&lt;/b&gt;</RiskHeading>
  <RiskNarrativeTextBlock contextRef="Duration_01Feb2019_01Feb2019S000001624_Member">When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and investment results may vary substantially over time and from period to period. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allocation Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Sub-Adviser may not allocate assets of the Fund among strategies or asset classes in an optimal manner, if, among other reasons, it does not correctly assess the attractiveness of a strategy or asset class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that a counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credit Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the issuers of certain securities or the counterparties of a derivatives contract or repurchase contract might be unable or unwilling (or perceived as being unable or unwilling) to make interest and/or principal payments when due, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Debt securities are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the obligation experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the net asset value (&amp;#8220;NAV&amp;#8221;) of the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Currency Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the value of the Fund&amp;#8217;s foreign currency holdings and investments denominated in foreign currencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with the fact that the value of debt securities typically changes in response to various factors, including, by way of example, market-related factors (such as changes in interest rates or changes in the risk appetite of investors generally) and changes in the actual or perceived ability of the issuer (or of issuers generally) to meet its (or their) obligations. During periods of rising interest rates, debt securities generally decline in value. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, debt securities generally rise in value. This kind of market risk is generally greater for funds investing in debt securities with longer maturities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivatives Risk&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument may not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure, (2) derivative contracts, including options, may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, (3) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, (4) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to credit risk, for example, if the counterparty does not meet its obligations (see also &amp;#8220;Counterparty Risk&amp;#8221;), and (5) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. As a general matter, when the Fund establishes certain derivative instrument positions, such as certain futures, options and forward contract positions, it will segregate liquid assets (such as cash, U.S. Treasury bonds or commercial paper) equivalent to the Fund&amp;#8217;s outstanding obligations under the contract or in connection with the position. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to pursue its investment strategy, including its strategy of investing in certain derivative instruments, may be limited to or adversely affected by the Fund&amp;#8217;s intention to qualify as a RIC, and its strategy may bear adversely on its ability to so qualify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging Markets Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in securities of issuers tied economically to emerging markets, which entails all of the risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers detailed below under &amp;#8220;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&amp;#8221; to a heightened degree. These heightened risks include: (i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization, and less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the smaller size of the markets for such securities and a lower volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility; (iii) greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and (iv) certain national policies that may restrict the Fund&amp;#8217;s investment opportunities, including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equity Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that stock prices will fall over short or long periods of time. In addition, common stocks represent a share of ownership in a company, and rank after bonds and preferred stock in their claim on the company&amp;#8217;s assets in the event of bankruptcy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exchange-Traded Funds (&amp;#8220;ETF&amp;#8221;) Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the price movement of an ETF may not exactly track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund&amp;#8217;s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growth Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in growth stocks that may be more volatile than other stocks because they are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company&amp;#8217;s growth potential. Growth-oriented funds will typically underperform when value investing is in favor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hedging Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that, although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;High Yield Debt Securities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that below investment grade securities or unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as &amp;#8220;high yield securities&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;junk securities&amp;#8221;) are more likely to default than higher rated securities. The Fund&amp;#8217;s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. The market value of these securities is generally more sensitive to corporate developments and economic conditions and can be volatile. Market conditions can diminish liquidity and make accurate valuations difficult to obtain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Illiquid and Restricted Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the Sub-Adviser may not be able to sell illiquid or restricted securities, such as securities issued pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss. Securities of non-U.S. issuers, and emerging or developing markets securities in particular, are subject to greater liquidity risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. When interest rates decline, the value of fixed rate securities already held by the Fund can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of existing fixed rate portfolio securities can be expected to decline. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mid-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in securities of mid-cap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline significantly as market conditions change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in mortgage-backed securities, and includes interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, which may be heightened in connection with investments in loans to &amp;#8220;subprime&amp;#8221; borrowers. Certain mortgage-backed securities are also subject to prepayment risk. Mortgage-backed securities, because they are backed by mortgage loans, are also subject to risks related to real estate, and securities backed by private-issued mortgages may experience higher rates of default on the underlying mortgages than securities backed by government-issued mortgages. The Fund could lose money if there are defaults on the mortgage loans underlying these securities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-U.S. Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk associated with investing in non-U.S. issuers. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (for non-U.S. securities not denominated in U.S. dollars); future foreign economic, financial, political and social developments; nationalization; exploration or confiscatory taxation; smaller markets; different trading and settlement practices; less governmental supervision; and different accounting, auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements) that may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies. These risks are magnified for investments in issuers tied economically to emerging markets, the economies of which tend to be more volatile than the economies of developed markets. In addition, certain investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains or other income or proceeds. Those taxes will reduce the Fund&amp;#8217;s yield on any such securities. See the &amp;#8220;Taxation&amp;#8221; section below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational and Technology Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures that affect the Fund&amp;#8217;s service providers, counterparties, market participants, or issuers of securities held by the Fund may adversely affect the Fund and its shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepayment Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates. This may cause the Fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates. This may adversely affect the NAV of the Fund&amp;#8217;s shares. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portfolio Turnover Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that high portfolio turnover will increase a Fund&amp;#8217;s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Estate Securities Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that an investment in real estate securities will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. Property values or income may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, cultural or technological developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;REIT-Specific Risk&lt;/b&gt; includes the risk that an investment in the stocks of real estate investment trusts (&amp;#8220;REITs&amp;#8221;) will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. An investment in a REIT also may be adversely affected or lost if the REIT fails to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Securities Market Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously. Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small-Cap Company Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies either directly or indirectly through investments in ETFs, closed-end funds or mutual funds (&amp;#8220;Underlying Funds&amp;#8221;) may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value Investing Risk&lt;/b&gt; is the risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value. Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks. Value-oriented funds will typically underperform when growth investing is in favor.</RiskNarrativeTextBlock>

As with all mutual funds, the Fund&amp;#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance prior to February 1, 2015 reflects returns achieved when the Fund was sub-advised by a different sub-adviser. If the Fund&amp;#8217;s current management had been in place for the prior periods, the performance information shown would have been different. The Fund&amp;#8217;s performance reflects applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the periods presented, without which returns would have been lower.

    <footnote id="footnote_NetExpensesOverAssets" label="footnote_NetExpensesOverAssets" role="http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/footnote" type="resource" lang="en-US">The Fund accrues deferred income tax liability for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments, the distributions received by the Fund on equity securities of master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) considered to be return of capital and for any net operating gains. The Fund’s accrued deferred tax liability, if any, is reflected each day in the Fund’s net asset value per share. The Fund’s deferred tax liability, if any, depends upon the Fund’s net investment gains and losses and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and may vary greatly from year to year depending on the nature of the Fund’s investments, the performance of those investments and general market conditions. Therefore, any estimate of deferred tax liability cannot be reliably predicted from year to year. See “Net Asset Value” in the Fund’s prospectus. Total annual Fund operating expenses before deferred taxes (after expense reimbursement) were 2.78%, 3.53% and 2.52% for Class A, Class C and Class Y shares, respectively.</footnote>
